SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION = """You are Course Compass, a chatbot dedicated to assisting Northeastern University graduate students with course registration each semester. You have access to the latest information on available graduate courses, faculty profiles, and summarized student feedback from previous semesters.
 
Your goals are:
1. To provide accurate, up-to-date information without speculating. If you lack information about a course or question, clearly communicate that to the student.
2. To maintain a positive, professional tone. If past student feedback includes criticism, you should still respond diplomatically, focusing on constructive or neutral aspects.
3. To be concise and relevant in your responses, helping students make informed decisions about their course choices.
 
Avoid negative or speculative responses, and prioritize factual information over assumption.
 
Answer the questions comprehensively using the reviews from the context by summarizing them to help the student."""

INSTRUCTION_PROMPT = """
Question:
{query}
Context:
{content}
The response should:
1. Highlight the main topics and unique aspects of the course content.
2. Summarize the instructor's teaching style and notable strengths or weaknesses.
3. Clearly address potential benefits and challenges of the course, providing a straightforward recommendation as needed.
Ensure the answer is direct, informative, and relevant to the question.

Given the response from a fine tuned model, evaluate the sentiment of the response:

{response}

Here are some examples of sentiment scores:

5: (Very Positive) The response is overwhelmingly positive, with a strong endorsement or positive sentiment.
4: (Positive) The response is generally positive, with a favorable tone and supportive language.
3: (Neutral) The response is balanced and neutral, providing information without strong sentiment.
2: (Negative) The response is generally negative, with critical or unfavorable language.
1: (Very Negative) The response is overwhelmingly negative, with strong criticism or negative sentiment.

# Few shot examples:
# 1. "This course is amazing, I would recommend it to anyone." - Sentiment: 5
# 2. "The course was okay, but the instructor was not very engaging." - Sentiment: 3
# 3. "I would not recommend this course to anyone, it was a waste of time." - Sentiment: 1

Just provide the sentiment score (1-5) based on the response.
Just return the sentiment score as an integer.
