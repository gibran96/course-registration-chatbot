## Instruction to Reproduce
To reproduce this data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Account**: Make sure you have an active Google Cloud account.
2. **Project Setup**: Create a new GCP project or use an existing one. Note down the `PROJECT_ID`.
3. **Billing Enabled**: Ensure billing is enabled for your project.
4. **Google Cloud SDK**: Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to interact with GCP resources.
5. **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python 3.10 is installed.

### Step 1: Set Up GCP Services and Resources

#### 1.1. Enable Required APIs

Go to GCP Console - 
1. BigQuery - Enable API
2. Cloud Composer - Enable API
3. VertexAI - Enable API


#### 1.2. Set Up Cloud Storage Buckets

1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket to store data and pipeline artifacts. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` and `PROJECT_ID` with your values.

   ```bash
   export BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name>
   gcloud storage buckets create gs://$BUCKET_NAME --project $PROJECT_ID --location=<region>
   ```
   Make sure the region is coherent with the composer region, or select multi-region bucket.

2. Create folders inside the bucket for organizing data and other artefacts:

   ```bash
   gsutil mkdir gs://$BUCKET_NAME/data
   ```

#### 1.3. Set Up BigQuery Dataset

1. Create a BigQuery dataset to store processed data.

   ```bash
   export DATASET_NAME=<your-dataset-name>
   bq --location=<region> mk --dataset $PROJECT_ID:$DATASET_NAME
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Airflow with Cloud Composer

1. **Create a Cloud Composer Environment**:
   - Go to the **Cloud Composer** page in the GCP Console.
   - Create a new Composer environment, specify Python 3 as the runtime, and select the same region as the other resources.
   - Note the `Composer Environment Name` and `GCS Bucket` associated with Composer for later steps.

2. **Upload DAGs and Scripts**:
   - Update the github workflows to match your GCP environment (Project, Bucket, etc). The workflow will take care of uploading the files to the bucket.

4. **Update Environment Variables** in Composer to reference the GCS bucket, BigQuery dataset, and other configurations. These can be set in the Airflow `Variables` section within the Composer UI.
   - You can use the environment file provided to setup the composer environment. Go to the Composer -> Airflow UI -> Admin -> Variables -> Import Variables
   - Upload the file.

6. **Python Package Dependencies**:
   - Update the `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies.
   - Install the dependencies in Composer by specifying the path to `requirements.txt` in the Composer environment configuration.

### Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup with GitHub Actions

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - The `gcd-upload.yaml` file should handle uploading code to GCS on pushes to specific branches.
   - The `python-tests.yaml` file should handle unit tests and linting.

### Step 4: Testing the Pipeline

1. **Trigger the Pipeline**:
   - You can trigger your pipeline by running the Airflow DAGs through the Composer UI or setting specific schedules for each DAG as defined in the code.
   
2. **Verify Data in BigQuery**:
   - After successful DAG runs, check your BigQuery dataset for expected tables and data to ensure the pipeline processed and loaded data correctly.

3. **Logs and Debugging**:
   - Monitor logs from Airflow in the Composer environment to debug issues. Logs are available for each task within the DAG.

4. **Alerts and Anomaly Detection**:
   - Change the environment variable for email in the composer environment to receive alerts regarding any anomaly detected, errors in the code and the status of the DAG run.

## Data Version Control(DVC)
We store all our data in Google Cloud Storage Bucket and use the versioning capability provided by GCS to maintain data versions.

## Alerts and Anomaly Detection
1. We have written custom code to detect any anomalies in our data pipeline. 
2. In our PDF processing pipeline, we detect any changes in the PDF's format and validate whether all the fields are getting parsed as we expect them to. If we find any changes to the field names, we classify the PDF as an anomaly and trigger an alert to the user.
3. For banner data, if we do not get any information about the faculty for any course, we send an alert and skip processing that entry.
4. This pipeline also acts as our schema validation pipeline as we parse only the fields we want in our database.

## MLMD
1. We are capturing all the metadata based on the pre-processing pipeline which parses and processes the PDFs in our database. We store all the metadata in a Cloud SQL DB for proper tracking.
   
## Pipeline Flow Optimization
1. We have tracked the Gantt chart for all the DAGs that we have created, we make sure that every task is modular and consumes minimal time for execution.
2. We have also implemented parallelization in some of our pre-processing functions.
3. We have optimized our resources to optimise the cost and wait time for each pipeline task.(for example, reducing time from 10min->3.5min for one of the DAGs)
