# Course Registration Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to develop an LLM-powered chatbot to streamline and simplify the course registration process for college students. The chatbot will integrate data from multiple sources, including Banner and Trace, to provide personalised course recommendations, verify program requirements, check prerequisites, and offer insights on professor reviews. The system will be built using Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) and will incorporate MLOps best practices, including monitoring and CI/CD pipelines, to ensure robust and efficient operation.

This repository hosts the data pipeline designed to collect, process, and store data related to Northeastern University course offerings and student feedback.


## Data Pipeline - Key Components and Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
The pipeline collects three main types of data:
- **Course Information**: Web scraping scripts fetch details about course offerings from the NEU Banner system, including CRN, title, instructor, etc.
- **Student Feedback**: Extracts student feedback from NEU Trace instructor comments reports, which are available as PDF documents and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for processing.
- **Training Data**: Uses specific seed queries and refined data from BigQuery to generate structured data for training purposes.

### 2. Data Processing
The collected data undergoes several stages of processing:
- **PDF Data Extraction**: Python-based scripts analyze the PDF files to extract relevant course evaluation comments.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant details and standardizes the data to ensure consistency across different sources.
- **Structured Data Creation**: Organizes the cleaned data into structured datasets optimized for analysis.

### 3. Train Data Generation
Using the `train_data_dag` in Airflow, the pipeline generates seed data for training a model. This process involves:
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches initial data from BigQuery and performs similarity searches to refine the dataset.
- **LLM Response Generation**: Generates responses from a language model (LLM) based on the seed queries and processed data.
- **Data Upload**: The generated data is uploaded to GCS and then loaded back into BigQuery to be used as training data.

This automated DAG enables systematic preparation of data needed for training and ensures consistency in the generation process.

### 4. Data Storage
The processed data is stored for easy access and analysis:
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Intermediate results, final datasets, and training data are stored in designated GCS buckets.
- **BigQuery**: Structured datasets and training data are ingested into BigQuery tables for efficient querying and analysis.

## Airflow DAGs Overview

### 1. **Banner Data DAG Pipeline** (`banner_dag_pipeline`)
This Airflow DAG focuses on fetching data from the NEU Banner system, processing it, and storing it in BigQuery. The steps are as follows:

## Data Version Control(DVC)
We store all our data in Google Cloud Storage Bucket and use the versioning capability provided by GCS to maintain data versions. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1020a971-2c58-4fc3-b419-0da0f8c7c9ae)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39aa025d-aaea-4de0-ade2-316653c65150)

## Alerts and Anomaly Detection
1. We have written custom code to detect any anomalies in our data pipeline. 
2. In our PDF processing pipeline, we detect any changes in the PDF's format and validate whether all the fields are getting parsed as we expect them to. If we find any changes to the field names, we classify the PDF as an anomaly and trigger an alert to the user.
3. For banner data, if we do not get any information about the faculty for any course, we send an alert and skip processing that entry.
4. This pipeline also acts as our schema validation pipeline as we parse only the fields we want in our database.

## MLMD
1. We are capturing all the metadata based on the pre-processing pipeline which parses and processes the PDFs in our database. We store all the metadata in a Cloud SQL DB for proper tracking.
   
## Pipeline Flow Optimization
1. We have tracked the Gantt chart for all the DAGs that we have created, we make sure that every task is modular and consumes minimal time for execution.
2. We have also implemented parallelization in some of our pre-processing functions.
3. We have optimized our resources to optimise the cost and wait time for each pipeline task.(for example, reducing time from 10min->3.5min for one of the DAGs)
