# Course Registration Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to develop an LLM-powered chatbot to streamline and simplify the course registration process for college students. The chatbot will integrate data from multiple sources, including Banner and Trace, to provide personalised course recommendations, verify program requirements, check prerequisites, and offer insights on professor reviews. The system will be built using Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) and will incorporate MLOps best practices, including monitoring and CI/CD pipelines, to ensure robust and efficient operation.

This repository hosts the data pipeline designed to collect, process, and store data related to Northeastern University course offerings and student feedback.


## Data Pipeline - Key Components and Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
The pipeline collects three main types of data:
- **Course Information**: Web scraping scripts fetch details about course offerings from the NEU Banner system, including CRN, title, instructor, etc.
- **Student Feedback**: Extracts student feedback from NEU Trace instructor comments reports, which are available as PDF documents and uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for processing.
- **Training Data**: Uses specific seed queries and refined data from BigQuery to generate structured data for training purposes.

### 2. Data Processing
The collected data undergoes several stages of processing:
- **PDF Data Extraction**: Python-based scripts analyze the PDF files to extract relevant course evaluation comments.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes irrelevant details and standardizes the data to ensure consistency across different sources.
- **Structured Data Creation**: Organizes the cleaned data into structured datasets optimized for analysis.

### 3. Train Data Generation
Using the `train_data_dag` in Airflow, the pipeline generates seed data for training a model. This process involves:
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches initial data from BigQuery and performs similarity searches to refine the dataset.
- **LLM Response Generation**: Generates responses from a language model (LLM) based on the seed queries and processed data.
- **Data Upload**: The generated data is uploaded to GCS and then loaded back into BigQuery to be used as training data.

This automated DAG enables systematic preparation of data needed for training and ensures consistency in the generation process.

### 4. Data Storage
The processed data is stored for easy access and analysis:
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Intermediate results, final datasets, and training data are stored in designated GCS buckets.
- **BigQuery**: Structured datasets and training data are ingested into BigQuery tables for efficient querying and analysis.

## Airflow DAGs Overview

### 1. **Banner Data DAG Pipeline** (`banner_dag_pipeline`)
This Airflow DAG focuses on fetching data from the NEU Banner system, processing it, and storing it in BigQuery. The steps are as follows:

- **get_cookies_task**: Retrieves authentication cookies to access Banner data.
- **get_course_list_task**: Obtains a list of courses from the Banner system.
- **get_faculty_info_parallel**: Collects faculty information for each course, running tasks in parallel.
- **get_course_description_parallel**: Fetches course descriptions in parallel for efficiency.
- **dump_to_csv_task**: Converts the data into a CSV format for easier handling and debugging.
- **upload_to_gcs**: Uploads the CSV file to Google Cloud Storage.
- **load_banner_data_to_bq**: Loads the Banner data from GCS into BigQuery.
- **Success Email**: Sends an email notification upon successful data loading.

This pipeline streamlines the process of gathering and storing course and faculty information from the Banner system. 

### 2. **PDF Processing Pipeline** (`pdf_processing_pipeline`)
This Airflow DAG is set up to process NEU Trace course review data. It fetches data, processes it, and then stores it in a BigQuery table. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **select_distinct_crn**: Selects unique Course Registration Numbers (CRNs) to identify distinct courses.
- **get_crn_list**: Fetches a list of CRNs to be processed.
- **get_unique_blobs**: Retrieves unique PDF files from the data source.
- **process_pdfs**: Extracts data from each PDF.
- **preprocess_pdfs**: Prepares the extracted data for storage by cleaning and structuring it.
- **upload_to_gcs**: Uploads the preprocessed data to Google Cloud Storage.
- **load_courses_to_bigquery** and **load_to_bigquery**: Loads processed course and review data into specific BigQuery tables.
- **Success Email**: Notifies the team upon successful completion of the data processing.
- **trigger_train_data_pipeline**: Triggers the training data pipeline once PDF processing is complete.

This pipeline is essential for organizing and storing course review data in a structured format for analysis.


### 3. **Train Data DAG** (`train_data_dag`)

![Train Data DAG](./assets/imgs/Train_Data_DAG.png)

This Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is responsible for generating seed queries to train a model. It involves several steps:

- **check_sample_count**: Ensures that there are enough samples available for training.
- **get_bq_data**: Retrieves data from BigQuery to be used for training.
- **get_initial_queries**: Generates initial queries based on the data retrieved.
- **bq_similarity_search**: Uses BigQuery to perform similarity searches, which help in refining the data for training.
- **generate_llm_response**: Generates responses from a language model based on the seed data.
- **upload_to_gcs**: Uploads processed data to Google Cloud Storage.
- **upload_gcs_to_bq**: Loads the data from Google Cloud Storage back into BigQuery.
- **trigger_dag_run**: Triggers additional DAG runs if necessary.
- **success_email**: Sends an email notification upon successful completion of the pipeline.

This DAG is designed to automate the preparation and processing of training data in a systematic way.

These DAGs automate and organize different stages of the data pipeline, each targeting a specific dataset (training data, course reviews, or Banner data) for Northeastern University courses.
